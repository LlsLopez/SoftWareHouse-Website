                The goal of Soft-Ware House is to provide a website which contains a constantly growing 
                location of all different types of software </br> for easier access and availability
                to the user. We will provide a different variety of software, most of which is free, some </br>
                of which may be purchased, with the simple click of a button, whether it be a redirection link,
                or a download page. While some of the </br> software may be created by our team, users and software creaters
                are encouraged to email our team to request to </br> add their own software for public sharing
                so that others may benefit from it too.
